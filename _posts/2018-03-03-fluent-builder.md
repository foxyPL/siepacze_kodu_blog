This week I had occasion participated in training organised by company which I provide my services. 
The main goal of training was improve our knowlege about design patterns, and all other stuff that we can call a good practices.

Our exercises relied on analyzing fragments of code (that was not really pretty), next on trying to pick up suitable pattern and finally on refactoring those fragments
with chosen pattern.

When we stopped at the exercise with builder pattern, one thing motivated me to make this post.
To be honest I had only two occasions to implement and use fluent builder pattern.
